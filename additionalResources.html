							<p>Meaningful participation begins from understanding the issue. While everyone are at different starting points, there are many mediums and avenues for one to find out about the climate change issue from different perspectives. We have also listed some events because they would offer you a chance to meet and hear from others, something we don’t do nearly enough which is sorely important. We have tried to curate articles which are helpful in showing the extent and urgency of the problem, examining existing policy conditions in Singapore so that they will be helpful in giving you an informed voice when crafting your submission. We will be updating this page along the way as well.
							<br>So dig around the list we have compiled and see what you are interested to find out more about, or what knowledge you may think you lack or share them with others if you think they communicate the issue in an effective way. Do also reach out to us if you have come across something great that isn’t listed here!
							<br>Happy browsing!

						<h2>Books</h2>
						<ul>
						<li><b style="color:#90EEA9;">"This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs Climate"</b> by Naomi Klein is a critical look at how underlying values of capitalism and neoliberal politics have led us to the climate crisis today, and how they continue to inform climate policies that are counter-productive such as geo-engineering. Klein also writes about ways in which climate action must be collective and premised on reclaiming the publics.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Watch</h2>
						<ul>
						<li><b style="color:#90EEA9;">"Before the Flood"</b>- A Documentary available on Netflix with Leonardo Dicaprio showcasing the urgency of the climate issue and its impacts on the most vulnerable natural and human habitats.</li>
						<li><b style="color:#90EEA9;">TEDTalks</b> - There are more than 100 TedTalks which discuss climate change. Some of the ones we recommend which will hopefully shift perspectives and are relevant to our understanding of the issue in Singapore include:
							<ul>
							<li><b style="color:#90EEA9;">"100 solutions to reverse global warming"</b> by Chad Frischmann which talks about the concept of “drawdown” and existing solutions which can help us achieve them through either (1) replacing existing fossil fuel-based energy generation with clean, renewable sources, (2) reducing consumption through technological efficiency and behavior change and (3) biosequestering carbon in our plants' biomass and soil through photosynthesis.</li>
							<li><b style="color:#90EEA9;">"A healthy economy should be designed to thrive, not grow"</b> by Kate Rowort, an economist who talks about how our current world is addicted to growth which has led to extractivism and inequality. She shares her vision of re-building a world that is regenerative with economies that are distributive, through systemic design.</li>
							</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Join or Host</h2>
						<ul>
						<li><b style="color:#90EEA9;">"Climate Conversations"</b> Find a group of friends and learn/ talk about climate change together. Climate Conversations will provide you with the resources to steer the discussion in a way that keeps it friendly, open and forthcoming.</li>
